**Remember**: There may be scenarios where the chatbot provides a response that is not accurate or relevant to the user's query. This is due to limited data availability and the generative nature of the chatbot's responses. If you have a question that the chatbot can't answer, or if you need more detailed information, please check the official UM Shuttle Bus service resources. Besides, please ensure the words you use are correct and clear to get the best response from the chatbot.
